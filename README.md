## End Note

While working on this project I stumbled upon the idea of creating a Social Media Assistant, that could automatically wish birthdays on every social media platform like LinkedIn, Facebook, or even Whatsapp. Show you all the messages, and posts in one place so that you don’t get addicted to each app. Being on social media these days has been a necessity and liking and wishing for birthdays is kind of a duty of everyone because your loved ones expect that from you. They don’t care how busy you are or if there is some other important work you want to accomplish or not.

In short, I am thinking of creating a social media assistant or a common social media app, completely decentralized for only some exclusive members, because you will be required to share your social media credentials since the public APIs of those social media don’t support that, and it’s against most of the social media platforms who exploits your dopamine. So, it would only be for a few 100 people, completely decentralized and addiction-free.
